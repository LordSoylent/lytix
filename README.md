Lytix is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It is currently under development and plans are to pull in Bitcoin's improvements for a PIVX clone.

It will be Proof of Stake after a 100,000 block Proof of Work period with masternodes and staked wallets supporting the network.
