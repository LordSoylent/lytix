[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lytixchain/lytix.png)](https://travis-ci.org/LytixChain/lytix) [![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/LytixChain/lytix.svg)](https://github.com/lytixchain/lytix/tree/v1.1.4)

Lytix is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It is currently under development and plans are to pull in Bitcoin's 0.16 improvements such as the lightning network for a PIVX clone.

It will be Proof of Stake with masternodes and servicenodes supporting the network. Servicenodes will be used to host applications and smart contracts utilizing tokens to record transactions supporting the customer applications written for those servicenodes.
